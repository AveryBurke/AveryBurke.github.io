        <p><a href="https://averyburke.github.io/tic-tac-toe/">Play some tic-tac-toe</a> while youâ€™re waiting for me to add more content</p>
        <p>In the unlikely event that you get bored of tic-tac-toe you can look at my incomplete data visualization app <a href="https://averyburke.github.io/pie/">pie</a>. The visualization itself is generated using D3, running in a web-worker, and the app state and UI are written in React. The datum are users in an imaginary database. Use the sidebar to select what user attributes are visualized as slices (like a pie chart) and what user attributes are visualized as rings. You can also use the sidebar to rearrange the order in which the data is visualized and to filter out users by attribute. Come back in the near future to see more functionality in the UI and a richer data visualization.</p> -->
